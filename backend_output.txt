A "backend" in Terraform determines how state is loaded and how an operation such as apply is executed. This abstraction enables non-local file state storage, remote execution, etc. By default, Terraform uses the "local" backend, which is the normal behavior of Terraform you're used to.


Output values are like the return values of a Terraform module, and have several uses: A child module can use outputs to expose a subset of its resource attributes to a parent module. A root module can use outputs to print certain values in the CLI output after running terraform apply
