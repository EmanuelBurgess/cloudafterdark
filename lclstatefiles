Local State files are the local copy of the file that keeps track of all the things you have deployed via terraform.
Terraform is a declarative language. Meaning terraform looks at your code and matches what is already deployed. Terraform then
makes the changes needed for your deployed infrastructure, to match the state file. This why you can delete a resource, by simply removing the resource from your code and then applying the code.
